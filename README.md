# RSA Cryptography Application

This is a Java Swing application that demonstrates RSA encryption and decryption using user-provided keys and messages.


## Introduction

The RSA Cryptography Application provides a graphical user interface for performing RSA encryption and decryption. It allows users to generate key pairs, enter messages, and view the encrypted and decrypted results.

## Features

- Generate RSA key pairs.
- Encrypt plaintext messages using a public key.
- Decrypt ciphertext messages using a private key.
- View the results of encryption and decryption.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Generate RSA key pairs using the "Generate Key" button.
3. Copy and save the generated keys (public and private).
4. Enter a plaintext message in the "Message" text area for encryption.
5. Paste the recipient's public key in the "Key" text area for encryption.
6. Click the "Generate" button to encrypt the message.
7. The encrypted message will be displayed in the "Encrypted message" text area.
8. To decrypt an encrypted message, paste your private key in the "Key" text area for decryption.
9. Enter the encrypted message in the "Message" text area for decryption.
10. Click the "Generate" button to decrypt the message.
11. The decrypted message will be displayed in the "Decrypted message" text area.

## Getting Started

Just download the RSACryptography.exe to run the program
